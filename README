Move Blocks and Eat Stuff is a puzzle/strategy game based on the ideas and
mechanics of Supaplex (http://www.elmerproductions.com/sp/). You could consider
Move Blocks and Eat Stuff to be a minimalist interpretation of Supaplex, but
really that would be giving me too much credit.


Your goal in each level is to collect all the items (magenta) and then go to the
exit (lime-green). On some levels there may be extra items that you don't need
to collect. There are also lots of other objects you can interact with - rocks,
bombs, enemies, triggers, and more.

You lose if something explodes next to you (an enemy or bomb) or something falls
on you. Unlike in Supaplex, the enemies don't hurt you upon contact, but they do
tend to get in the way. Blow them up by dropping something on them - the blue
dudes will turn into items when you destroy them!


Some notable differences from Supaplex's rules:
- You can use bombs you don't have. However, if you're in debt (have used more
  bombs than you have collected), then you won't be able to finish the level.
- After dropping a bomb, you can pick it up again before it explodes. This
  technique is required in some levels.
- Gravity doesn't work. This makes some levels much easier. Enemy freezing,
  however, also doesn't work.
- Triggers disappear when used. (In Supaplex, the terminals remained solid.)
- Both types of enemies move at the same speed.


When you run Move Blocks and Eat Stuff, it will start at the latest level you
haven't yet completed. To reset the completion states for all levels, delete
 ~/.mbes_completion.


Building:
- Install Xcode (or some other variant of GCC).
- Put a levels.dat file in the same directory as the source. (You can get a
  levels.dat file from the Supaplex site, linked above. Rename it to lowercase.)
- Run `make`. This will create Move Blocks and Eat Stuff.app.
- Run Move Blocks and Eat Stuff.app. Play the game. Be impressed with the
  graphics and sound.
